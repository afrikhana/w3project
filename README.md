#Understanding the algorithms behind calculations
//prompt () method helps the used to key in a value 
"with a clear understanding, when one creats a html form for marks whatever the user inputs and clicks on a submit button, they will get their results."

//Enter marks from 0 - 100: && //used the prompt function to input the marks
This helps the person the know the range thats was described reference to their marks ors speed

// Define the tax rates and grosspay
 whatever is discribed as a grossplay is an instance from an object that has values that we were to claculate ...their values that would be deducted when reducing it by the rates.

   // Get user inputs
   here we request the users to enter  their basic salary and benefits

  -- grossSalary helps use get the total of the benefits plus basic salary

-- Thus after // Get taxable income
as we know to calculate gross profit first we need to minus the current price with its original value to get the profit

// Calculate tax  &&  // Calcthe NHIF Deductions
In this we create a for loop to list the rates one by one with the groospay  thus we creat a variable that gets us the value of the calculated tax one by one.

 // Calc NSSF Deductions
 he will be able to get the current deduction/ the current price after geting the gross profit 

  // Calc net salary
  net salary is the base calculation of all you deductions, gross profit and tax
